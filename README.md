# LHSC Operating Room App
This project is the product of an innovative initiative for the london health science centre, when I worked voluntarily for Dr Abdul as his research collaborator.The app is designed to improve the operating room wait time at LHSC to give user access to the information used to be only available on one single computer in specific location.
This is the front end demo built with angular. Right now the I don't have the backend running due to the nature of the product being non-profit, so some page might not be fully functional. But please feel free to check it out the main page at
